This is a simple maze game that runs on an Arduino with an 8x8 LED display and a 5-position switch sensor. Originally this started as a project for school.

Possible future features:
 * turning levels into objects
 * randomized start and goal positions from a list
 * levels that change over time
 * win animations
 * teleports
 * adding sound with a third sensor
 * dynamically generated levels
