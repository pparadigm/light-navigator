Using an 8x8 LED display (MAX 7219) and a 5-position switch sensor (basically a simple joystick) controlled by an Arduino, we plan to create a simple game. Ultimately, we would like to use the joystick to direct the “player character” (PC) represented by a blinking LED around a maze displayed on the 8x8 board. The PC will be able to move in 4 directions. There are a few steps along the way:

* get the 8x8 display working [done]
* create a level [done]
* be able to move the PC in the level
* (optional) use input from joystick
* failure states
* win screen
* more levels

Depending on how well this project is scoped and how hard each step is, we might have to scale back.
