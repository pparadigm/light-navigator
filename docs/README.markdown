Light Navigator
----------------

*This is a simple maze game that runs on an Arduino with an 8x8 LED display and a 5-position switch sensor. Originally this started as a project for school.*


**Optimizations:**
* store level data elsewhere

**Gameplay experience:**
* consistent pip blink
* randomized start and goal positions from a list

**Possible future features:**
 * win animations
 * levels that change over time
    - rotary door level
 * teleports
 * dynamically generated levels
 * different game modes
    - snake
    - three-lane dodge
 * adding sound with a third sensor
