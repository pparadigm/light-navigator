Light Navigator
---------------

Using an 8x8 LED display (MAX 7219) and a 5-position switch sensor, we plan to create a basic game. Ultimately in this project, we would like to use the sensor to direct a “unit” represented by a lit LED on the 8x8 board around a maze. The “unit” will be able to move in 8 directions. There are a few steps along the way:

* get the 8x8 display working
* get the sensor working
* code the parts to work together
* (optional) translate control of one of the devices into Assembly
*create a level

Depending on how well this project is scoped and how hard each step is, we might have to scale back.
